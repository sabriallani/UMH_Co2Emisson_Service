# UMH_Co2Emisson_Service
Our UMH_Co2Emisson_Service is based on the Climatiq API.
However, This API helps us calculate the environmental footprint created by a broad range of emission-generating activities.

We simplify the process of converting your operational activity data into CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) estimates, allowing you to understand your impact on the environment and identify actions to manage and reduce it.

Operational activity data can be generated from any actions that result in greenhouse gas emissions, including vehicle rides, energy consumption, flights, logistical operations, manufacturing, agriculture, heating or cooling of buildings, and countless other daily activities.

Using the Climatiq REST API, you can take data from your software and systems and automatically transform that it into CO2e values, using emission factors from a range of validated sources available in the Open Emission Factor Database (OEFDB).

This service can calculate :

 Emissions generated by a vehicle travelling over a distance.

 Emissions produced by consumption of energy in kWh, terajoules, gigajoules or MMBTU.

 Emissions produced by moving a number of passengers over a given distance in kilometers, miles, nautical miles, meters or feet.

 Emissions produced by moving goods of a certain weight (in kilograms or metric tons) over a distance (in kilometers, miles, nautical miles, meters or feet).
